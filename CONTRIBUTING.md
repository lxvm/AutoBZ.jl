## How to contribute to AutoBZ.jl

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/lxvm/AutoBZ.jl/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/lxvm/AutoBZ.jl/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch (read more on [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/lxvm/AutoBZ.jl/discussions/new?category=ideas) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

* Once your proposal is positively accepted, open a new GitHub pull request with the new feature.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use AutoBZ.jl in a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/lxvm/AutoBZ.jl/discussions/new?category=q-a). Your question may also help others!

* If you want to contribute to the documentation, then open a new GitHub pull request, as described above
