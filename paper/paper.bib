  abstract = {JuMP is an open-source modeling language that allows users to express a wide range of optimization problems (linear, mixed-integer, quadratic, conic-quadratic, semidefinite, and nonlinear) in a high-level, algebraic syntax. JuMP takes advantage of advanced features of the Julia programming language to offer unique functionality while achieving performance on par with commercial modeling tools for standard tasks. In this work we will provide benchmarks, present the novel aspects of the implementation, and discuss how JuMP can be extended to new problem classes and composed with state-of-the-art tools for visualization and interactivity.}

  abstract = {We present wannier90, a program for calculating maximally-localised Wannier functions (MLWF) from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be attached to or mixed with other bands. The formalism works by minimising the total spread of the MLWF in real space. This is done in the space of unitary matrices that describe rotations of the Bloch bands at each k-point. As a result, wannier90 is independent of the basis set used in the underlying calculation to obtain the Bloch states. Therefore, it may be interfaced straightforwardly to any electronic structure code. The locality of MLWF can be exploited to compute band-structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces at modest computational cost. Furthermore, wannier90 is able to output MLWF for visualisation and other post-processing purposes. Wannier functions are already used in a wide variety of applications. These include analysis of chemical bonding in real space; calculation of dielectric properties via the modern theory of polarisation; and as an accurate and minimal basis set in the construction of model Hamiltonians for large-scale systems, in linear-scaling quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and for efficient computation of material properties, such as the anomalous Hall coefficient. wannier90 is freely available under the GNU General Public License from http://www.wannier.org/.

Both available under open-source licenses. Nature of problem: Obtaining maximally-localised Wannier functions from a set of Bloch energy bands that may or may not be entangled. Solution method: In the case of entangled bands, the optimally-connected subspace of interest is determined by minimising a functional which measures the subspace dispersion across the Brillouin zone. The maximally-localised Wannier functions within this subspace are obtained by subsequent minimisation of a functional that represents the total spread of the Wannier functions in real space. For the case of isolated energy bands only the second step of the procedure is required. Unusual features: Simple and user-friendly input system. Wannier functions and interpolated band structure output in a variety of file formats for visualisation. Running time: Test cases take 1 minute. References:[1]\,N. Marzari, D.

  abstract = {Wannier interpolation is a powerful tool for performing Brillouin zone integrals over dense grids of k points, which are essential to evaluate such quantities as the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity or Boltzmann transport coefficients. However, more complex physical problems and materials create harder numerical challenges, and computations with the existing codes become very expensive, which often prevents reaching the desired accuracy. In this article, I present a series of methods that boost the speed of Wannier interpolation by several orders of magnitude. They include a combination of fast and slow Fourier transforms, explicit use of symmetries, and recursive adaptive grid refinement among others. The proposed methodology has been implemented in the python code WannierBerri, which also aims to serve as a convenient platform for the future development of interpolation schemes for other phenomena.},
